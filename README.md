# BART.go

BART.go streamlines the BART experience, distilling the interactions involved in
planning a BART trip to the bare minimum. Novice and expert BART riders alike
benefit from the application’s minimal cognitive requirements, providing the
detailed trip planning information a novice rider needs, while providing the
means for expert riders to interact solely with real-time information that can
directly delay their trip. Users need only indicate their destination station;
the application plans the rest of the trip. Through a minimalistic interface,
the watch UI helps pace users, keeping them informed of their ETA to the station
in relation to the train’s ETA.
